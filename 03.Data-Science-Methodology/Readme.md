# **About this Course**

Despite the recent increase in computing power and access to data over the last couple of decades, our ability to use the data within the decision making process is either lost or not maximized at all too often, we don't have a solid understanding of the questions being asked and how to apply the data correctly to the problem at hand.

This course has one purpose, and that is to share a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.

Accordingly, in this course, you will learn:

- The major steps involved in tackling a data science problem.
- The major steps involved in practicing data science, from forming a concrete business or research problem, to collecting and analyzing data, to building a model, and understanding the feedback after model deployment.
- How data scientists think!

## Week 1

### From Problem to Approach and From Requirements to Collection

In this module, you will learn about why we are interested in data science, what a methodology is, and why data scientists need a methodology. You will also learn about the data science methodology and its flowchart. You will learn about the first two stages of the data science methodology, namely Business Understanding and Analytic Approach. Finally, through a lab session, you will also obtain how to complete the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stages and the Data Requirements and Data Collection stages pertaining to any data science problem.
