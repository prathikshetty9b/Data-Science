# Built-in Functions

## Create `PETRESCUE` Table : [`Create-Table.sql`](Exercise-03-Create-Table.sql)

```sql
-- Drop the PETRESCUE table in case it exists
DROP TABLE PETRESCUE;
-- Create the PETRESCUE table 
CREATE TABLE PETRESCUE (
	ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	ANIMAL VARCHAR(20),
	QUANTITY INTEGER,
	COST DECIMAL(6,2),
	RESCUEDATE DATE
	);
-- Insert sample data into PETRESCUE table
INSERT INTO PETRESCUE VALUES 
	(1,'Cat',9,450.09,'2018-05-29'),
	(2,'Dog',3,666.66,'2018-06-01'),
	(3,'Dog',1,100.00,'2018-06-04'),
	(4,'Parrot',2,50.00,'2018-06-04'),
	(5,'Dog',1,75.75,'2018-06-10'),
	(6,'Hamster',6,60.60,'2018-06-11'),
	(7,'Cat',1,44.44,'2018-06-11'),
	(8,'Goldfish',24,48.48,'2018-06-14'),
	(9,'Dog',2,222.22,'2018-06-15')
	
;
```

## Aggregate Functions : [`Aggregate.sql`](Exersice-03-Aggregate.sql)

```sql
--Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
SELECT SUM(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
SELECT SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
SELECT MAX(QUANTITY) AS MAX_QUANTITY FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
SELECT AVG(COST) AS AVG_COST FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
SELECT AVG(COST/QUANTITY) AS AVG_COST FROM PETRESCUE
WHERE ANIMAL = 'Dog';
```

## Scalar and String Functions : [`Scalar-And-String.sql`](Exercise-03-Scalar-And-String.sql)

```sql
--Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
SELECT ROUND(COST) FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
SELECT LENGTH(ANIMAL) AS LENGTH FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(ANIMAL) FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
SELECT * FROM PETRESCUE
WHERE LOWER(ANIMAL) = 'cat';
```

## Date and Time Functions : [`Date-And-Time.sql`](Exercise-03-Date-And-Time.sql)

```sql
--Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) AS DAY 
FROM PETRESCUE
WHERE UPPER(ANIMAL) = 'CAT';

--Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
SELECT SUM(QUANTITY) AS NUM_OF_RESCUES
FROM PETRESCUE
WHERE MONTH(RESCUEDATE) = '05';

--Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
SELECT SUM(QUANTITY) AS NUM_OF_RESCUES
FROM PETRESCUE
WHERE DAY(RESCUEDATE) = '14';

--Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
SELECT (RESCUEDATE + 3) AS CHECKUP_DATE FROM PETRESCUE;

--Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the rescue date.
SELECT (CURRENT_DATE - RESCUEDATE) FROM PETRESCUE;
```
